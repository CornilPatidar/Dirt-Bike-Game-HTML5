## Dirt Bike Game — HTML5 Canvas 🏍️

Tiny browser game made while I’m learning game dev and physics. It’s simple, a bit glitchy on purpose, and all about practice and iteration.

### Play Online ▶️
- Try it on itch.io: [Dirt Bike Game](https://cornil.itch.io/dirt-bike-game)

### Controls 🎮
- Left/Right (A/D): accelerate / brake
- Up/Down (W/S): lean forward / back
- R: restart after a crash

### What’s Inside 🧪
- HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JavaScript
- Lightweight physics (gravity, rotation, collisions)
- Single‑file setup in `index.html` to keep it easy to read

### Learning in Progress 📚
- I’m still building my skills, so the bike can feel janky/glitchy at times.
- There are no checkpoints, ending, high score, or levels (yet!).
- I’m shipping small and often — my next projects on itch.io will add those features.

### Notes 💡
- Works best in a modern desktop browser
- Arrow keys or WASD; prevent page scroll is enabled

Thanks for playing and following along! 🙌
